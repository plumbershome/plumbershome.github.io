<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming.
