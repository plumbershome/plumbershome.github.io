<h3>Plumbing Services Around Bentonville AR</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.
