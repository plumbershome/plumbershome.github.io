<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Willis TX?</h3>
<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is entirely odor free. The egg smell related to gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you need to take to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
