Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
