<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Petersburg VA</h3>

I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
