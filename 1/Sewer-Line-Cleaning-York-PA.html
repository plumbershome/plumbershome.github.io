<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested each year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system.
