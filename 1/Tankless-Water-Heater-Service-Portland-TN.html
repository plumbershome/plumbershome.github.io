<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
