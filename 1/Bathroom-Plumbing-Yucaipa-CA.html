<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
