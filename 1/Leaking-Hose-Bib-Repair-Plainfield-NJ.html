<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
