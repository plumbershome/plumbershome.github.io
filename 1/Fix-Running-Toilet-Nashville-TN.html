<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique set out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
