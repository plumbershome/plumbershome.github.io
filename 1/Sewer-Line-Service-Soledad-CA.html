<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to manage softer natural waste. It might cause it to jam and not work appropriately if bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades. Use of a video camera in your sewer line can help us much better detect sewer backups and sewer line and drain problems.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and hot water heaters free of tough water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
