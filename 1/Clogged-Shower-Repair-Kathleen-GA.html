Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
