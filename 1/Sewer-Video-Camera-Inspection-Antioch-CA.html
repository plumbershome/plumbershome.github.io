<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
