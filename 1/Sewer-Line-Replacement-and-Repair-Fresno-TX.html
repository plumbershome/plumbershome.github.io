New meters need to fulfill regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers might need an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the building authorization. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will provide an offense notification, and a particular amount of time is set aside to correct the issue.</p>
