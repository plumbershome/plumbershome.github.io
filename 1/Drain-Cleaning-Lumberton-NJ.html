<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Lumberton NJ</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
