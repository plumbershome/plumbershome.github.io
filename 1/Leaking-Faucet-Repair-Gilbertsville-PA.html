Well, very first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your house? If it was developed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently). And if the house was built before World War II, then it likely requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
