<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Anaconda Montana</h2>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
