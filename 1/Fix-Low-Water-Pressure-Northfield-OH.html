<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the technique laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee.
