<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be appropriate if health or ecological factors require limiting salt. With time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regrowth, has three cycles: rinse, recharge and backwash. The regrowth procedure can be set up immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

Harts is a terrific local company to work with. How will you handle a severe clog after it blocks a chemical drain cleaner?
