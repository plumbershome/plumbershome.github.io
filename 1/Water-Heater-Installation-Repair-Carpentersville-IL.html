<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
