<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
