<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from damaging impurities.
