When the disposal gets jammed to avoid damaging the motor, a red button at the bottom of the unit journeys. First, disconnect the disposal, then push the red button to eliminate the jam.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Have your assistant hold the flange in place while you locate yourself beneath the sink or lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on top to prevent it from moving.
