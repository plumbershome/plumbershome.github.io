<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Although the professional concurred that the client did the best thing in her attempts to tighten the pipes, the specialist saw that the pipe had actually become extremely corroded for many years which a PVC pipe may be better matched for the client's needs. He shut off the water system to the house, removed the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Prior to leaving the home, the technician brought back water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
