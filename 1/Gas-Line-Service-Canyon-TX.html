And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your journey lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small everyday hassles - that the majority of people just deal with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
