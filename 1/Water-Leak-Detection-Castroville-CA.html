<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply decades of protection. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all cause the assembly to degrade in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
