When the disposal gets jammed to prevent harming the motor, a red button at the bottom of the system journeys. Initially, unplug the disposal, then press the red button to remove the jam.</p>
<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The unit must grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however should then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be.
