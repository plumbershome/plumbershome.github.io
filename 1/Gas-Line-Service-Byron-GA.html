<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Byron GA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
