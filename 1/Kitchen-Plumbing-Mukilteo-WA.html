If you reside in a cold-weather environment, we highly recommend repiping your home during spring or summer season so you don't have to stress over freezing temperature levels during the repiping process. Normally, if the issue is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is likely the best option. When more than one drain is clogged or sluggish, it can show a larger issue with your plumbing system.
