<p>In the long run, a gas heater might be a cheaper alternative than an electric, however the preliminary cost of the heater and the installation can be considerably greater. A gas heater also needs a little bit more to correctly keep throughout the years than an electric heater will. In the end, the expenses saved over the years will more than cover the costs of water for a larger family. Smaller households and individuals might do better with an electric hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" hot water heater as explained in the section listed below.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
