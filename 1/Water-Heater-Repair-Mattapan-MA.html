Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you have actually attempted to repair them call for professional support.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of situations that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
