<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its performance below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if essential, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
