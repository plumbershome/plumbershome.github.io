Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio house brings minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To prevent rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting destructive products. By having the anode rod inspected regularly and changed as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>For commercial facilities consisting of hotels, universities, and dining establishment chains, problems with a warm water heater can have a big impact on daily operations and should be prevented whenever possible.
