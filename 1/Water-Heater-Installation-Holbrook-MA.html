<p>In a watering system, backflow has 2 causes: back siphonage or back pressure. Nearly all components on a hot water heater can be fixed or changed other than for the tank itself. When the tank rusts through, there is no chance to repair it; replacement is the only option. Turn the waste disposal unit over and get rid of electrical cover plate. Pull out wires.

The failure is a result of piping products and fittings breaking down, but is incorrectly credited to bad craftsmanship in many cases. Some house owners presume that due to the fact that their piping has lasted some years without failure that it is not malfunctioning. Really, most polybutylene pipes last for as much as twenty years before failing.</p>

PEX is easy to install, which indicates the cost of installation might be low as well. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare. In general, it's an affordable solution that will stand the test of time. We typically suggest this material, though it will depend.</p>
