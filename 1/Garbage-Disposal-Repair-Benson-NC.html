<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An approved, properly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically gets rid of the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any substantial changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Those of us in the market know that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually greatly lowered the variety of reported incidents that happen within our water systems. This has at times led to people believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever truly have been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the danger it provides and then install the correct protection.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
