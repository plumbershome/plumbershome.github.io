<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Henrico VA?</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg smell connected with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should require to protect yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
