Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
