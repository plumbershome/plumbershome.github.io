<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Weston CT</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, properly set up and preserved backflow assembly basically eliminates the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is not enough to make any significant changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
