Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
