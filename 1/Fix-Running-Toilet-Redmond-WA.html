<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Redmond WA</h3>
<p>The garbage disposal as we understand it today was first sold to Americans in the mid-1930s. The units blew up in popularity throughout the 1940s through word-of-mouth. Today, it's approximated that over 50% of American households have a garbage disposal in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Defense Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas appliances.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has already been fouled. Again, it is recommended to examine the maker's directions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair needs can be fixed fairly quickly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain might need to be taken apart, taken a look at, and cleared prior to being replaced. In many cases, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to discuss repair alternatives.</p>
