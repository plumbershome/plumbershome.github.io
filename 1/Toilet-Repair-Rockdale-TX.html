<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may need to look into using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
