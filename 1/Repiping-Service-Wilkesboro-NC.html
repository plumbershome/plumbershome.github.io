The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
