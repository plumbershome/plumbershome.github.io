A small camera attached to a cable is placed into a pipe or a line and sends video footage to the plumber. This tool can be vital in identifying problems and helping a plumber plan repairs. The next level up, in terms of price and protection offered, is called a pressure vacuum breaker, or PVB. This device avoids back siphonage only. A pressure vacuum breaker has a spring-loaded check valve that will close whenever water stops flowing with an air relief valve that opens to break the siphon when pressure drops to 1 PSI.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping.
