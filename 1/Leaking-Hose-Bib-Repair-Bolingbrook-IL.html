<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the method laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
