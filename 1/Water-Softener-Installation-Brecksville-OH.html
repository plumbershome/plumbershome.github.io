<p>Sodium consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be proper if health or ecological factors demand restricting salt. Gradually, the beads end up being coated with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration process can be arranged immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve.

After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
