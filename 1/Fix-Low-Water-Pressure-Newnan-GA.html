State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors usually include paying an application charge and passing an extensive business, law and building regulations test. Some community colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for prospective plumbing entrepreneur might include evidence of financial trustworthiness, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending on the length from the main gas line. Installing a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the lawn costs $300 to $1,400.
