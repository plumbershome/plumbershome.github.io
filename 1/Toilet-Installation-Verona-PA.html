A fouled # 2 Examine Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
