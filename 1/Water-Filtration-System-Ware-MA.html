New meters must satisfy regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may need a special meter for their services, restricting your choices.

Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a specific amount of time is allocated to correct the issue.</p>
