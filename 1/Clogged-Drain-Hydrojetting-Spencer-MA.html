Backflow is the undesirable circulation of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or substances into the drinking water system. In most states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or service. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and pipes.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
