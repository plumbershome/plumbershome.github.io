<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.
