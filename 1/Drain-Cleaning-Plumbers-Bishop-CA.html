Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It might not be installed in any location where it may ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems.
