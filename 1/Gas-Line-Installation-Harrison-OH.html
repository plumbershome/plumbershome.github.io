<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes must have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be utilized to achieve this, and might be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>A clogged pipe can also enable water to leak into a structure. This not just damages the structural stability of a building, but it can likewise let water in through the floorboards, triggering them to stain and weaken with time. If a clogged pipe is left ignored for too long, it could result in flooding and stagnant water, which brings in and breeds mildew, mold, and unwanted pests-- all of which are major health threats.
