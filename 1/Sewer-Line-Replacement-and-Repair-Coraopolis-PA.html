<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company. A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We utilize specialized cutting edge tools and diagnostic methods to make sure that your kitchen and bathrooms sinks, tubs and showers, toilets, floor drains, and main sewer lines are all in leading condition.
