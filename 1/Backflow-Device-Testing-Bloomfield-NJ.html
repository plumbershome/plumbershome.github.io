<p>As water heaters age, especially when they approach the years mark, you might start to observe some concerns. Any kinds of weird sounds usually recommend difficulty. Popping noises, for instance, suggest that the water is boiling (which need to never ever occur). Sediment build-up or a faulty thermostat represent common factors for boiling water. Water naturally contains the minerals that can add to problems with a water heater, and locations with hard water may need more frequent flushes or service.</p>

This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise. A word to the wise: most house owner insurer will pay to repair a water leak and water damage to your house twice. But if it happens a 3rd time, you run the risk of having your insurer drop you.
