<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is a good idea to check the maker's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
