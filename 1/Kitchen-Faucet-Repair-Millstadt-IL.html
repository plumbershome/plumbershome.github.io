It might not be installed in any location where it may ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't permit the use of a PVB at all, so contact your water company. A PVB backflow preventer may spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it needs to be installed in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
