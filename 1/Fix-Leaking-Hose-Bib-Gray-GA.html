Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in a lot of homes and accounts for over 30 percent of total household water usage. Toilets made prior to the 1980s may use up to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the job and still squandering water. Later on models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another common problem house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is frequently triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is effective and inexpensive. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into an appropriate drain. When the water heater is being changed, an ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is.</p>
