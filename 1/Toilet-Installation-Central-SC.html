<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
