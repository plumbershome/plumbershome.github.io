<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses. As you home ages the water traveling through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes good sense. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as essential. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.

<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
