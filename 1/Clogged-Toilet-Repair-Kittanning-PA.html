<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>If you have a more recent unit, a simple repair or replacing individual parts may be all that's needed to get your hot water heater working once again. You may be lured to bond or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that difficulty could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and prevent larger leakages down the roadway.</p>
