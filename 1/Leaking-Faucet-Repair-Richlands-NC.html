It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks.

<p>A leaking toilet is another common issue property owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is frequently caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is effective and inexpensive. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain.
