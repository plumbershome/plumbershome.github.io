<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
