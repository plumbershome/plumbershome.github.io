<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
