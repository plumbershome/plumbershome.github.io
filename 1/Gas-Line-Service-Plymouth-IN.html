<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>As is the case with any plumbing home appliance or water treatment system, your water softener should be expertly set up and serviced. This is the only way to ensure that your system can manage the need of your household, and that it will in fact get the job done effectively. Maintenance requirements are minimal, but it does pay to have the system inspected for appropriate operation regularly.
