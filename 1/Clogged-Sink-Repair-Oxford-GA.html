<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home, this is one of the main and very first concerns that you need to ask yourself.

If your house was built before the 1970s, we strongly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly.
