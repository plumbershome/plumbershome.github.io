You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Contact your backflow prevention assembly producer or the item spec sheets to validate that the assembly is USC-approved You must also confirm the assembly is authorized in the orientation for which it is being set up (horizontal, vertical, etc.).
