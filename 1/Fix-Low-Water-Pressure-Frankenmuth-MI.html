<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Frankenmuth MI</h3>
<p>We aren't here to sway you in one instructions or the other - we install both gas and electrical water heaters - however we want to educate you on the benefits and disadvantages of both so you can make the option that best fits you.
