<p>Difficult water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as successfully. When washing items are used in difficult water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. If you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a few times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
