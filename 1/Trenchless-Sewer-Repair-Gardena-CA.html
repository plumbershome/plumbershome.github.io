<p>Our suggestion: Typically you'll want to opt for PEX pipes not only due to the fact that they are economical, but due to the fact that they're easy and reliable to install. If you have questions about what type is pipe is right  for your home, consult a plumber for more info.

Many toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area include clogged drains, which take place when materials get stuck in the pipes. In many cases, this includes physical waste and can be cleared up with judicious use of a plunger. When it does not, however, you need a certified plumber to make it right.</p>

Assemblies not presently noted must have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
