<p>Read your insurance policy completely if your polybutylene pipes have actually failed. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied since the basic HO-3 property owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time."

Double check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is correct as soon as you have actually checked out through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

You can duplicate this process if it doesn't work the very first time.
