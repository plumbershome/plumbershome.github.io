<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be impractical in many situations to install a pipe segment of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
