<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
