<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
