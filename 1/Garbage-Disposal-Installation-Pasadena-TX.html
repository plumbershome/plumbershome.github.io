<p>Minimizing or eliminating water hardness is done with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process takes place. A softener is consisted of various parts, each having their own distinct function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a routine schedule.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Pasadena TX</h3>
<p>For the function of water treatment, hardness is determined in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert between gpg and ppm use the following factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm. Additionally, milligrams per litre is comparable to parts per million and can be used synonymously.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
