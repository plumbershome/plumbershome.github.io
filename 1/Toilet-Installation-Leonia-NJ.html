<p>Difficult water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as efficiently. When washing items are utilized in tough water - tough water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water. If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a good concept to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Often, if you have multiple drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and determine the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>
