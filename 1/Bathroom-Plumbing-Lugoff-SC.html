<p>An rdc resembles a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it usually does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be equipped with test dicks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be utilized to separate only nonhealth risks and is planned for usage just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the waste disposal unit since they can impede the blades.

Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
