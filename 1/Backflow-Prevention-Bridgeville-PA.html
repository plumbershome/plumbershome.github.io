<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
