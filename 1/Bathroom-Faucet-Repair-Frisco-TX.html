It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly.

Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models.
