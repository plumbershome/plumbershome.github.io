Rather, water is just warmed when you in fact switch on a warm water fixture.

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
