<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Ambler PA</h3>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be treated quickly if the clog is shallow and basic. For a lot of blockages you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this doesn't solve the issue then you may also need to contact a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>If you decide to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none fall down the drain). There are several faucet designs, so you may not have the ability to inform what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a good time to consider whether you wish to upgrade the faucet with a new design.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
