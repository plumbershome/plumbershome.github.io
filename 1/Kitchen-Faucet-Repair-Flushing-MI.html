<p>Changing the ring that seals the connection between the bowl and the sewer line indicates completely eliminating the whole toilet. So it's a. great time to consider getting a brand brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
