<p>When a water system is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is important to ensure a backflow condition is not developed. The repair professional should beware to not create a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations down to lower elevation. This backsiphonage condition might lead to a contamination of the plumbing system if the backflow prevention assembly was set up as a service defense assembly. Abrams, Paul.

While gas leaks are uncommon, you need to leave the structure immediately if you observe a smell like rotten eggs in your home.
