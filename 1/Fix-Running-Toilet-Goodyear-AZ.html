When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
