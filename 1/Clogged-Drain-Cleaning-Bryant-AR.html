<p>Installation and replacement expenses are often similar, though replacement usually will not require additional charges, such as application fees. New meters must meet regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers might require an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building license. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a specific amount of time is allocated to correct the problem.</p>
