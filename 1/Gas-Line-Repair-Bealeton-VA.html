Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
