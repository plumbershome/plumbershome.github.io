<p>A newly set up water heater must not produce unusual noises, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things intensify significantly for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
