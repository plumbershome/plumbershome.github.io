<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
