If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Installing a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides much better, safer drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy healthier skin and hair. To be prepared, determine the distance from the outlet to the top of each disposal before you eliminate the old system. You should likewise lower the tee that the discharge pipe links to if the brand-new system's outlet is lower. Loosen up the two nuts that link the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below. Try lowering the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. You'll have to replace it with one that's a little longer if it's not.</p>
