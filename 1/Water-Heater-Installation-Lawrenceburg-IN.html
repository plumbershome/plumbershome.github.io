The unit needs to grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
