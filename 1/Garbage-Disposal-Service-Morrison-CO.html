<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
