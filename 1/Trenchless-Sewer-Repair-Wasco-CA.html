A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
