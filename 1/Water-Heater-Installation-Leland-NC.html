Lots of obstructions are brought on by putting too much toilet paper into the bowl. Know how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never place any paper product into the toilet bowl other than toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog even more down the drainpipe.
