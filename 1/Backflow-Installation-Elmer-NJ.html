<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable if health or environmental factors necessitate limiting sodium. In time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration procedure can be scheduled instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.
