<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Whitinsville MA</h3>
<p>When a water system is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is necessary to make certain a backflow condition is not developed. The repair technician must be careful to not produce a backsiphonage condition by draining pipes the water from a higher elevations to lower elevation. If the backflow prevention assembly was installed as a service security assembly, this backsiphonage condition could lead to a contamination of the plumbing system. Abrams, Paul.
