<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
