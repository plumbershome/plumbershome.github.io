Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately maintained. Making sure the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the system. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
