<p>You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, with time, it still does wear away. We can help if you are presently experiencing clogged drains! When several of your drains are clogged, water will often start to back up into your sink, which can result in weird smells. A blocked drain can also cause problems when flushing the toilet and result in other drain problems, like water leakages and breaking pipes.</p>
