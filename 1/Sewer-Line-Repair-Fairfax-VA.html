<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and easily removable segments, and enabled cleaning.</p>

They dramatically reduce your water heating expenses because there is no tank" of water for the system to continually heat and re-heat all day long. Rather, water is only heated when you actually turn on a hot water fixture.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
