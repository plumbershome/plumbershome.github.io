<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Methuen MA</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
