<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the method laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
