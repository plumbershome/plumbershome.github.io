Commercial assemblies must be tested every year.

Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
