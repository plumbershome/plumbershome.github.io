Commercial assemblies must be tested every year.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl.

Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
