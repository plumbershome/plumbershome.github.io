Our team of extremely skilled professionals will minimize the impact our work has on the structure of your home or office and get your system working quickly, safely, and cost effectively. Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>Lubrication may aid with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the service technician put together the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not polluted. In most cases the best lubricant is water. The usual use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be lightly lubed to ensure they do not present of their retainer. Using too much lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out earlier by drawing in dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the part. The correct amount of lubricant should make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You must never ever see portions or globs of lubricant.</p>
