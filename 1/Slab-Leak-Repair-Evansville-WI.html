<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. An RP is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be utilized to isolate health or nonhealth threats.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
