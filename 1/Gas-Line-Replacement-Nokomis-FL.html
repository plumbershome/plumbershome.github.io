Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
