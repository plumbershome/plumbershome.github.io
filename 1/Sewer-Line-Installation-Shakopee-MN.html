However is a plumbing disaster imminent or just a concern for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you definitely do not wish to do the job prior to it's necessary. When it's time for replacement, here's how to examine your plumbing system and know. They also need to be set up at least 6 inches above the greatest emission point.
