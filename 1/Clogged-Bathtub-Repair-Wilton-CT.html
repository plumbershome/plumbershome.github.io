<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Wilton CT</h3>
<p>This is a totally legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drains. However, it adds a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a reasonably little round device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>It is essential to keep your drainage system in good shape. It's what keeps your house clean, safe and without water accumulation.
