<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

He turned off the water supply to the home, eliminated the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the residence, the technician restored water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>
