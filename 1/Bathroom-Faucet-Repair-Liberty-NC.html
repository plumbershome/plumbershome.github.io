The pro will next check your hot water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is taking a look at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).

The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
