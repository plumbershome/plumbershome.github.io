<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
