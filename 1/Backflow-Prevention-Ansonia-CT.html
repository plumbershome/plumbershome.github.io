<p>However, garbage disposals are likewise vulnerable to clogs, especially if too big a product was put into them. If they aren't correctly cleaned and kept, they can also block your pipes. They might establish odors if too much food is left within them for too long, and some less expensive models are also susceptible to leaks.
