<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers ought to only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to eliminate difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that will not stick to any surface in your house, keeping your devices and hot water heaters devoid of tough water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
