<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
