There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust.

<p>This involves getting rid of damaged areas of old piping and setting up brand-new piping in its place when a repiping service is needed. This is essential to support the plumbing system and guarantee the structural integrity. Copper piping has been the standard for many years and is normally considered as the premier type of repiping. We use Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. We believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>
