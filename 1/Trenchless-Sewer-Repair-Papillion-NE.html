Typically, if the issue is confined to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the very best option. When more than one drain is clogged or slow, it can show a larger problem with your plumbing system.

The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into an appropriate drain. An ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
