<p>You should update the piping as well if you are updating your gas devices. Gas leaks can be harmful and frightening. We're here for you every step of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to set up a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
