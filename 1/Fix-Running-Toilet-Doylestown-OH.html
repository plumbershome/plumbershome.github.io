<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
