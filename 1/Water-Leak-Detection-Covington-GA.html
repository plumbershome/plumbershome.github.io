Waste disposal unit service warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and 10 years.

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
