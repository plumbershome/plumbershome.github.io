<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 offered approaches. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining.

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>For commercial facilities consisting of hotels, universities, and dining establishment chains, problems with a warm water heater can have a substantial effect on daily operations and need to be avoided whenever possible.
