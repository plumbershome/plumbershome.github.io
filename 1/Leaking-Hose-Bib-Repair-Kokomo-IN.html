A plumber is needed if this is the case. When most people think about plumbers, they normally call them for water pipe problems.

<p>As hard water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. Softer clothing without difficult minerals trapped in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the run down gray triggered by hard water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, replacing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has fixed the issue we were having.</p>
