<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to prepare, I create a lot of meals. We established a short-term workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we required the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are very delighted that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly utilize this company once again and again in the future.</p>
