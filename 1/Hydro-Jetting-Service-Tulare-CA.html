<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the beginning of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our particular needs for our house. I will constantly utilize them and request for George particularly for all future issues or repairs. They were timely and offered very good rates for what we needed done. I highly suggest this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are a lot of quality kitchen sinks to choose from. For example, lots of consumers pick stainless-steel undermount sinks due to the fact that they can take a fair bit of abuse for many years. Enameled cast iron sinks are also back in favor, and they can be found in a large range of designs. You likewise need to choose about whether to have a single or multi-bowl  sink. The size of the bowl as well as further choices relating to the faucet are all elements of the procedure that we can help you with.</p>
