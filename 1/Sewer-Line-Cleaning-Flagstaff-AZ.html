Whether your gas line requires repairs or you require an entirely new installation, we can help. How typically a backflow preventer requires to be evaluated depends upon its type. There are two main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most frequently used in commercial centers.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
