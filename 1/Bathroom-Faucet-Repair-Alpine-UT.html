<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line indicates totally getting rid of the entire toilet. So it's a. great time to think about getting a brand new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
