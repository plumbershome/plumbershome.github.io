The city or Uruk contains the oldest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly removable and replaceable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Again, it is a good idea to inspect the manufacturer's guidelines for special safety measures.</p>
