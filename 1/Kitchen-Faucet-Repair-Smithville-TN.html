<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied (such as throughout water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Waste disposal unit service warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range between 2 and 10 years. Since the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might want to buy an extended guarantee.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
