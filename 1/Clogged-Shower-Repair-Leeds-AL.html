<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, effectively installed and kept backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability.
