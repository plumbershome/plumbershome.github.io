For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and harden or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak.
