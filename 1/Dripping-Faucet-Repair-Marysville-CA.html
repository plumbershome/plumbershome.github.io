The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather.

When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is typically used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
