<p>It's normally simpler to wire the new disposer before you install it. If the old installation was made without versatile conduit, now is the time to upgrade. Depending upon the level of care and maintenance carried out on it, your hot water heater will last in between 10-15 years. After that, you might start to discover a lapse in efficiency. The quality of your water system will also affect the durability of your unit; as discussed previously, without treatment difficult water will ultimately wear down on your hot water heater and trigger it to weaken a lot more quickly.</p>
