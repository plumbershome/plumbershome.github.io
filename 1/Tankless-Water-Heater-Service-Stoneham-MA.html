<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
