<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
