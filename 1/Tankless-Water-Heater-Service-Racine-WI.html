<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
