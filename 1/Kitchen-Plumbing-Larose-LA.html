<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet effectiveness- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of disposals: batch feed and constant feed. Most homes use continuous feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is turned on. When a lot of work is to be done in the kitchen, this is helpful. Batch disposals have a holding tank that accumulates waste till it is full and is then activated when the cover is closed. Our plumbers can help you choose which type of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
