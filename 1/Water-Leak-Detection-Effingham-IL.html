<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, happens. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
