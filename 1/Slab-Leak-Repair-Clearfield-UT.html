<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly removable and changeable sectors, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too short.
