<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Macomb MI</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
