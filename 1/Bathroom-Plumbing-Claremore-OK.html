<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
