<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RP works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or nonhealth threats.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instant hot shower that utilizes the point-of-use hot water heater; these home appliances will provide hot water continuously for the duration you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power issues or if the water heater is defective. In essence, it warms the water as needed with just the amount you need, thus taking away the loss incurred with using tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
