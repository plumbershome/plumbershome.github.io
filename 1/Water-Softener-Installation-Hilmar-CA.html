<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house.

Salt is usually used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
