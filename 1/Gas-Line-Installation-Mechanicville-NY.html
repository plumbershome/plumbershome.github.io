<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners.

Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Once again, it is suggested to examine the producer's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
