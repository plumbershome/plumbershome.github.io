<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
