If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
