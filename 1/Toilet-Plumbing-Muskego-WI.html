<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Since the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
