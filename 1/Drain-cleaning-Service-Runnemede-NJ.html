The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to get away.
