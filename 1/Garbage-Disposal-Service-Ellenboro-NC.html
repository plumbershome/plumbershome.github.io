<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested each year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
