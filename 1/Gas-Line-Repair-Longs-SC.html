The client has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently installed backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
