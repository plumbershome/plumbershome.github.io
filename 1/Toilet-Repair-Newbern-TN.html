<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Newbern TN</h3>
<p>If  you're tired of living with the side-effects of difficult water, a water softening system from RainSoft can offer you with the option you need. Ever since we initially opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a distinction in the lives of many homeowners in North America and all over the world. Our premium system, the EC4 entire house water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that uses a procedure of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that cause hard water. By changing the calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium ions that trigger water firmness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by resolving its source. Furthermore, thanks to its unique, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your common water usage patterns, adjusting its soft water shipment based on your requirements. In this method, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an endless supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to minimize these symptoms.</p>
