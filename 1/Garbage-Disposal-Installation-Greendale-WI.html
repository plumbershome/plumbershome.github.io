<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair in Greendale WI</h3>
<p>Salt intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors demand restricting salt, replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be appropriate. With time, the beads become coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has three cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be set up instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
