<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, check the directions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>Hydrojetting is an affordable and fast method to clear your drains. Call us today for your drain cleaning company. Water leaking from the system - Left unaddressed, rust can wear away the hot water heater tank liner, triggering water to leak from the system.
