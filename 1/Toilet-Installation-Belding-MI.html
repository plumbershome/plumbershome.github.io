<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and release water to the exterior if either check valve must leak.

For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
