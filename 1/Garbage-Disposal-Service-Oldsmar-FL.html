<p>Even if all appears well with your hot water heater, it's a great idea to schedule hot water heater service from time to time just to make certain that whatever is kosher. Sediment buildup is a typical issue with hot water heater New Orleans, specifically in older systems. Gradually, limescale, calcium, and magnesium can gather on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals need to be removed of the unit so they don't create a sediment barrier on the burner and disrupt water heater performance. Hot water heater filtration can eliminate these minerals and prevent a malfunction. The burner needs to also be examined periodically to make sure that the flame is blue with a yellow pointer. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will impact your hot water heater's efficiency, and it could release carbon monoxide gas fumes into your indoor air.</p>
