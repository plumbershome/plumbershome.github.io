<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
