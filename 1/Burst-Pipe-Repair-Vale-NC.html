<h3>Shower Repairs in Vale NC - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, affecting the water quality.
