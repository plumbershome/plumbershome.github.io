<p>In the long run, a gas heater might be a less expensive option than an electric, but the initial cost of the installation and the heater can be considerably greater. A gas heater also requires a bit more to properly maintain for many years than an electrical heater will. In the end, the costs saved over the years will more than cover the costs of water for a larger family. Smaller sized households and people might do much better with an electrical water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as explained in the area listed below.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
