With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler systems. He or she will eyeball noticeable pipes, and might run a camera inspection to examine the pipes' condition from the within. The mix of time and use wears away gas lines-- it's a natural occurrence, though no less difficult for homeowners. That's why Mr. Rooter Plumbing wishes to manage it for you.
