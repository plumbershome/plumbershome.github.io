<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin using a much healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to include salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on people with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance because the media can last approximately 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
