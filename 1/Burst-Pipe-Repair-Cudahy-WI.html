Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain tubes must have an air space. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap might be utilized to attain this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
