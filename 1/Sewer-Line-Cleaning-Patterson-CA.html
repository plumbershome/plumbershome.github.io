However, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
