A plan might be needed to acquire the license if new work is carried out such as replacement of gas piping. Ultimately, you'll need to count on a relied on plumber to recommend you whether it's time for a pipe replacement. And it's constantly great to get a 2nd and even 3rd  opinion prior to you embark on a replacement project. However there are a few ways you can mitigate the cost and inconvenience of the task.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To avoid this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
