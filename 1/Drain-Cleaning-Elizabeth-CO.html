<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
