A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
