The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer years of protection. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature or turbidity can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance.
