The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer years of protection. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature or turbidity can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might seldom need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
