<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>
