<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
