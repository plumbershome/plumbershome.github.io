There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away.

<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>A. We highly recommend a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from back or negative pressure in your irrigation system at shutdown from entering back into your water source, thus minimizing the threat of contamination of your water source. Lots of municipalities require the use of an authorized backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You might want to consult your local town prior to installing your irrigation system.</p>

<p>Finally, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
