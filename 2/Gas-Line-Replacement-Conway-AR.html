Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
