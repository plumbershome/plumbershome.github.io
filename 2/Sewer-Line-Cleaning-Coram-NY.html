<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. A lot of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with special venting systems also are readily available. However they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
