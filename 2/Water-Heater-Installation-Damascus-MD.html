<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Damascus MD</h3>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, bathtub, or shower) can be treated quickly if the obstruction is easy and shallow. For the majority of obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not resolve the problem then you might also have to hire a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same material and they may be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
