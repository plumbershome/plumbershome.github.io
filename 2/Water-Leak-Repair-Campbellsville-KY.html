<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
