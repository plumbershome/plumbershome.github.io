<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching task rather of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the very same material and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your whole house when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, reach you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
