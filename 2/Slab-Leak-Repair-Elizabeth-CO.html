<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
