<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
