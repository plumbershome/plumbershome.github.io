You'll need to install that initially if your disposal's installation will require a new installing flange in the sink. Remove it as discussed above if you're replacing an old disposer.</p>
<p>There are generally 2 kinds of disposals: aluminum and stainless-steel. Aluminum disposals are the most affordable, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are prone to corrosion and leaking.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that must also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
