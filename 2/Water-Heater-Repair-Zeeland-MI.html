<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
