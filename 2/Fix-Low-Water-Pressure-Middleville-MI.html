State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors normally include paying an application charge and passing a comprehensive business, law and building code examination. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools supply contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for prospective plumbing company owner may include proof of monetary trustworthiness, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
