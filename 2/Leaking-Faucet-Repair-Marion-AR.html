<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological reasons require restricting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be proper. In time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
