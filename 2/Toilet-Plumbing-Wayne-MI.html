<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
