<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
