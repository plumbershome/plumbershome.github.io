<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to leave.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure known as Design template Assisted Formation (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate caught ions.</p>
