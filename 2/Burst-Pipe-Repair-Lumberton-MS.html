<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>
