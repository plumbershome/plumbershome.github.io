<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jiggle and often even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your journey lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small daily troubles - that the majority of people simply live with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water lost every day by a bad seal.</p>
