The sodium uptake through softened water depends upon the solidity of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake originates from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.</p>
