Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
