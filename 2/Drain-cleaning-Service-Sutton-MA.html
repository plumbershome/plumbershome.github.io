I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
