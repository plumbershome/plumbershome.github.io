<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the technique laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up.
