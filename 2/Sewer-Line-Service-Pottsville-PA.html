<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
