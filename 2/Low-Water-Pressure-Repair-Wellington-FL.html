<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

Your waste disposal unit includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to insert into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. Try to insert a broom plunger or deal with into the sink drain opening and try to rotate the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench.

<p>Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet.
