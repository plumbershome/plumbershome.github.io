<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Edmonds WA</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
