From new bathroom components to custom-made counter tops, we genuinely have it all. Our stock makes us the best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in tough water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some home appliances. Water softening is generally accomplished using ion-exchange resins.

Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the system upside down and shake it out).</p>
