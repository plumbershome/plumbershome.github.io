<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
