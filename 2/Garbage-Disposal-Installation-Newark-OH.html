<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to remove difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stick to any surface in your house, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters without difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
