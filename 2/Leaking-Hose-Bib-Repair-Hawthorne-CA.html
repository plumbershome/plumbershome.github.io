<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security.

When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.
