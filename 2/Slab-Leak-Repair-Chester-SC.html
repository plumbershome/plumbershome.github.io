<p>The term difficult water" might sound like an oxymoron, however it's simply household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They also are reasonably undetectable through smell or taste, but they can be hazardous just the very same. Similar to our trenchless services, we will first perform pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
