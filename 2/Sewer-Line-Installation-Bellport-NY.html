If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
