<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Seattle WA</h3>
<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the various problems dealt with by the property owner, this is followed by among our comprehensive group of service technicians placing a camera into the drains to identify the blocked area and figure out how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain meant a snake would be used to pierce a hole in the drain to enable a small amount of wastewater to go through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
