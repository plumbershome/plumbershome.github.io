<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
