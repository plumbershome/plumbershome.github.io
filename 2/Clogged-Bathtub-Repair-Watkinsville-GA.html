<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

Generally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water turned off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disruption to your day-to-day routine.
