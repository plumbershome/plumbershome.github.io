New meters need to fulfill regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers might require an unique meter for their services, restricting your options. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the building authorization. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will issue an offense notice, and a particular amount of time is allocated to correct the issue.</p>
