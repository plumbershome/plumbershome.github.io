<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
