<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are offered. However they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
