<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming.
