There are 2 main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most commonly used in commercial centers.</p>
<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You may need to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
