<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true.
