<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
