<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
