<p>Leakages can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Since the tank or the entire toilet should be lifted off the floor for an appropriate repair, either of these leakages can be hard to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
