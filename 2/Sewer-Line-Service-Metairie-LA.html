<p>An Innovative solution allowing Utilities to proactively monitor their water networks, trace leaks and pinpoint their specific locations while utilizing extremely delicate acoustic sensing units, management software & mobile applications. Most plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the brand-new one at the same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This truly depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old system is to get rid of. In a lot of cases, removal will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall costs, but in many cases the expenses might be higher if additional pipes should also be changed.</p>
