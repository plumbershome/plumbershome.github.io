<h3>Blocked Sewer in Zephyrhills FL - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
