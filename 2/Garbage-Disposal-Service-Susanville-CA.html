<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method set out above.

This is particularly true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

The lubricant must be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water system is not polluted. In most cases the very best lubricant is water.
