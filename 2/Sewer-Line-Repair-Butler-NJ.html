Even if the unit is off, the blades are dangerous and sharp. Make sure the system is off, you can even turn off the breaker to make sure it can't be turned on by accident. Your garbage disposal features a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. If you can't find this wrench, then try to place a broom plunger or handle into the sink drain opening and attempt to rotate the jammed flywheel.
