<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
