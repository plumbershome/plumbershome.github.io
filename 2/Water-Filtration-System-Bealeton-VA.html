<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Bealeton VA</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
