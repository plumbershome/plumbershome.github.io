<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. However, it may be not practical in lots of circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
