<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal.

Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
