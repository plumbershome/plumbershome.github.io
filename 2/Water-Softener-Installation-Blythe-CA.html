<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are frequently used in plants, cooling towers, labs, laundries, swimming pools, lawn sprinkler systems, and fire sprinkler systems. Pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve designed to close with the help of a spring when water circulation stops. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above atmospheric pressure, preventing non-potable water from being siphoned back into the safe and clean system. The assembly consists of resilient, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
