<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Bellingham MA</h3>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process called Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And because these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of captured ions.</p>
