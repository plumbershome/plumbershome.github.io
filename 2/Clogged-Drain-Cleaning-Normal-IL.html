<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
