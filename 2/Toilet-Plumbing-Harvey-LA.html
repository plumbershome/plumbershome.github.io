If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop.
