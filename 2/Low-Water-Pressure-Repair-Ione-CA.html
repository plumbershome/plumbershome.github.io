Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Backflow preventer installation costs vary based on the particular website conditions, the size and quantity of the water service( s), and the proximity to a floor drain. For each device, the cost can range from a base of $7,500 to $15,000 for midsize buildings and $15,000 to $35,000 for larger buildings; this does not consist of the PE's or RA's design charges. The DEP filing cost is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing fee is a little over 1% of the approximated plumbing cost. The size of the device is likewise a factor in cost. For example, a one-inch device can start at $225, while a three-inch device might cost $2,800. Labor costs also increase with pipe size.</p>
