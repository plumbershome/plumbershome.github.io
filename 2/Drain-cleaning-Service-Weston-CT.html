<p>To assist avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach set out above.

When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free.
