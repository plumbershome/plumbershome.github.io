<p>When your hot water heater beings to weaken, you can see how it affects your daily convenience. With a hot water heater replacement, you'll solve your repair concerns, and have enhanced hot water heater performance as well. The salt uptake through softened water depends upon the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake originates from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
