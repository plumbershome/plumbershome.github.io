<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in great shape.</p>
