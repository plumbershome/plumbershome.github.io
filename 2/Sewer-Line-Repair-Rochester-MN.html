Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

If the problem is repeating or the damage is comprehensive, you might be better off repiping. For minor leakages and one-off problems, fixing the pipe is normally enough.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
