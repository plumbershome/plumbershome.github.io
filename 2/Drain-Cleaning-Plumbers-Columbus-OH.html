For most blockages you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this doesn't fix the problem then you may also need to hire a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
