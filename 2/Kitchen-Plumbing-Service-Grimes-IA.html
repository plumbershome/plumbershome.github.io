Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
