<p>The law also needs yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause penalties and termination of water service. Because backflow preventer devices are comprised of moving springs, seals, and parts and undergo corrosive substances, wear, and fatigue, it's vital to properly preserve them to ensure they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, along with enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is easier and more economical than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which should be regrowed using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up gradually, they slowly start to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
