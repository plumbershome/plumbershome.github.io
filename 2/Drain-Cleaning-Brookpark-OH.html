<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
