<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
