If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
