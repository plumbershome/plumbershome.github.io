<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
