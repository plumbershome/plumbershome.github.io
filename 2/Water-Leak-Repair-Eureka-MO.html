Displacing or restoring these ground-level fixtures can run conventional pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single job. In these instances, the cost of trenchless stays the very same; as digging is no longer needed, trenchless experts can completely repair or replace your harmed pipe without needlessly digging an inch of soil.</p>
