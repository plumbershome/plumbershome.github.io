<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I like to cook, I produce a great deal of dishes. We set up a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we recognized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 1 month. If it blocks again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
