And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those little day-to-day troubles - that many people just live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>
