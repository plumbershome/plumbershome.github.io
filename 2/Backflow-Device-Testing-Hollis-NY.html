It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly.

This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
