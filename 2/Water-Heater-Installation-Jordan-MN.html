<p>There are 2 popular mount systems used for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt mount (if you have actually had actually a disposer set up for a long time, it's most likely installed by doing this) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock").

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
