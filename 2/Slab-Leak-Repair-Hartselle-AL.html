<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt.
