An authorized, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any substantial changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>

If it does not work the first time, you can duplicate this process. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
