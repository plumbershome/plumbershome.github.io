<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home, this is one of the very first and main concerns that you must ask yourself. The age of your home is a vital part to understand whether you ought to repipe your house.

If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was built decades prior to that, chances are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>

The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are usually connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to local storm drains. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back circulation and prevent water collection on top of the structure's roof.</p>
