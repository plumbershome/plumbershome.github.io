<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
