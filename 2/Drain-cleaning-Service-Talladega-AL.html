Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak.
