<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
