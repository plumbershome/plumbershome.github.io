<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Mexico MO</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
