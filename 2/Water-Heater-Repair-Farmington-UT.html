Double flush valves are becoming increasingly more common, as both customers and makers look for brand-new ways to save water. Double flush toilets enable the user to choose the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong. We have actually all heard the old adage, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people discover that squicky - and so the double flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just using less water to do it.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
