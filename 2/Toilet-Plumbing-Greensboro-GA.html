<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Greensboro GA</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
