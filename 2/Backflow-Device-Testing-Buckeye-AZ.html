<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
