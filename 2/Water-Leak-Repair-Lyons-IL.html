<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
