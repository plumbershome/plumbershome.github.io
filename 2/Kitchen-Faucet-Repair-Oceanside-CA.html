<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
