<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
