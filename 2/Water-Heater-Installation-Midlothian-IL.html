<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
