When it pertains to the problem of hard water, a conventional water softener in fact eliminates calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is called momentary hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
