<p>Leaks are sly. While the time needed will differ based upon your house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you schedule an inspection. There's always the opportunity that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the starting time.

Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to schedule your consultation.</p>
