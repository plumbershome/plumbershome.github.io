<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
