Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave.
