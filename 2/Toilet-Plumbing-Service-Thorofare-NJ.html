<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
