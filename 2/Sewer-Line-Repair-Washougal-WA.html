<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
