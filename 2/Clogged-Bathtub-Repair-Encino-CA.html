In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested each year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested each year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
