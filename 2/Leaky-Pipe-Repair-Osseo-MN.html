<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The unit should grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but should then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be. It is likewise allowed to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finish (which is essentially an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
