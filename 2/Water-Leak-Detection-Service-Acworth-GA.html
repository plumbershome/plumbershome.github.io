<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
