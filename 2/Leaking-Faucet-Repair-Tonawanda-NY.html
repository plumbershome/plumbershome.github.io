Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative result on people with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals.

<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
