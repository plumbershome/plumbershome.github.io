These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply.
