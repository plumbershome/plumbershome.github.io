A plumbing inspection is a systematic process of assessing the critical locations of the plumbing system of a residential or commercial property.

Examine water or air test on system. Water test not less than the water working pressure of the system. Air test for piping systems other than plastic, not less than 50 psi. The test will be held for not less than 15 minutes without leaks.</p>
<p>An atmospheric pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, however no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will stand up to the test pressure defined without showing any evidence of leak or other defects. Mechanical evaluates utilized to determine test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses throughout inspection shall be considered to suggest the presence of a leak.</p>
