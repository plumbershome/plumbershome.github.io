<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
