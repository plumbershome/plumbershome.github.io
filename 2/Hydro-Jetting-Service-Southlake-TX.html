<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
