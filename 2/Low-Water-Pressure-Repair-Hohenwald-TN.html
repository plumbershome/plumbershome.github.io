You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated annually. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
