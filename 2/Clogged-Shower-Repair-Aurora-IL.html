<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A clogged toilet can be one of the most frustrating problems in your home. Our Albuquerque plumbers can unclog your toilet and offer you alternatives for preventing future problems. If your toilet is tough to flush due to the fact that you have to flush it multiple times, it may be the result of poor drain ventilation or a clog somewhere farther down the line.
