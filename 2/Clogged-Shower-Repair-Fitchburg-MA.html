If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you ought to require to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.

Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
