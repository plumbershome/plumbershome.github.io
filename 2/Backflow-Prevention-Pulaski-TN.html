<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
