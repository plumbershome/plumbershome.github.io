<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be utilized to accomplish this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
