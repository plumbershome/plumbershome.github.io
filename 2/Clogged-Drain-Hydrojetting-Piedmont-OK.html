It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
