Depending on the level of care and maintenance performed on it, your hot water heater will last in between 10-15 years. After that, you might start to notice a lapse in performance. The quality of your water system will also impact the longevity of your unit; as discussed earlier, unattended tough water will ultimately wear down on your hot water heater and trigger it to deteriorate far more quickly.</p>
