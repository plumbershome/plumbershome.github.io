<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>

Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in good shape.</p>
