<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
