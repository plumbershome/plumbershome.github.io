If you do not identify the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this issue due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
