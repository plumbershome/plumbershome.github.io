<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads become loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.
