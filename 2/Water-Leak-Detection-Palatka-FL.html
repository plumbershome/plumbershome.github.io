When the piping in your home begins to show any of these indications of deterioration, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The factor a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause.
