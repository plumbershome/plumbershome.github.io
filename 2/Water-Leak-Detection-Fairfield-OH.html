<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will help remove them. , if you would like to try the gentlest approach possibly try using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings initially!), if that doesn't do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to eliminate rust spots and it's readily offered at most hardware stores.</p>
