<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Collinsville OK?</h3>
<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this short area of pipe before it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs over time. If you discover your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are lacking warm water extremely rapidly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection.
