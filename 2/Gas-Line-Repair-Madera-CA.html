<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>

Potassium pellets are compatible with any water softener and can be bought at much of the exact same shops where sodium pellets are cost about the exact same cost. In many cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. If a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line, this type of situation may occur. A homeowner's policy may cover this type of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an utility company, it might be covered.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.
