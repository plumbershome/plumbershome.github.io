This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
