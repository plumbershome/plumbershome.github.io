In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>There are extra problems that may come up, which is why our knowledgeable plumbers will perform a comprehensive inspection of your unit to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed choice on whether your problem can be resolved by a simple repair or if changing the garbage disposal is eventually the better option.
