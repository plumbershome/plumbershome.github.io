I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
