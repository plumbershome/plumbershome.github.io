Do not create a connection in between an auxiliary water supply (well, cistern, body of water) and the water supply plumbing.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
