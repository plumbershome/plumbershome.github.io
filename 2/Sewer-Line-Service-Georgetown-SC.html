<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
