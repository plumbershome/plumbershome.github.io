<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Waxahachie TX</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
