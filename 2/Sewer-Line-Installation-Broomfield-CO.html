<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
