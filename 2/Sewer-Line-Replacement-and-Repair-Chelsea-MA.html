<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they generally take place in the lowest open drain. This kind of problem is generally the result of a clog in the line. If you don't spot the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this problem since a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
