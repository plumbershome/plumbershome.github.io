Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there may be other leakages you are unaware of. Leaks are a sure indication that your pipes are worn and old and need to be replaced. Rather than having to continually repair them, the best alternative. is to replace them.</p>

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
