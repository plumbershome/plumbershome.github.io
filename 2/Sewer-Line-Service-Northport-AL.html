<p>Natural Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is totally odorless. The egg odor associated with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you ought to require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
