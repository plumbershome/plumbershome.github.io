<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Services in Franklin</h2>

The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the positively charged minerals in the water (a procedure called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your home. Tankless technology makes sense.
