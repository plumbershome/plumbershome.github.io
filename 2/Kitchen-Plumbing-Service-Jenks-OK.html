<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true.
