<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with unique venting systems likewise are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
