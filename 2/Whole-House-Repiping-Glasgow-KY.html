A pressure vacuum breaker has a spring-loaded check valve that will close whenever water stops streaming with an air relief valve that opens to break the siphon when pressure drops to 1 PSI.</p>
<p>If you need to hardwire the system, wait till it's installed under the sink. Keep in mind: It's most likely a great concept to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later.
