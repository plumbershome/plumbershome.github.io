Your home's location, obstructions, the distance from your home to the main line, and local building regulations can significantly increase costs, though they normally do not surpass $2,000. Oftentimes, the gas company installs, owns, and keeps the gas line and gas meter as much as your home.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6).
