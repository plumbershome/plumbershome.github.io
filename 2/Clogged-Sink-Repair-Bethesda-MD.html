It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
