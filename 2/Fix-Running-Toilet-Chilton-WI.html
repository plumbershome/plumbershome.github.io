When the pressure drops for some factor such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation occurs, polluted water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique used.

For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and crack or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
