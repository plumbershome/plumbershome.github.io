<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.

As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
