<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is likewise acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of disposals: batch feed and constant feed. The majority of houses utilize continuous feed disposals, which implies the disposal will work as long as it is turned on. This is handy when a great deal of work is to be carried out in the kitchen. When the lid is closed, batch disposals have a holding tank that collects waste up until it is full and is then triggered. Our plumbers can help you decide which kind of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
