<p>Harts has remarkable customer service and reacted promptly to our plumbing emergency! Chris has been to our house in the past and is professional and extremely knowledgeable. Harts is a fantastic local company to deal with. How will you handle a severe clog after it obstructs a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can develop a hazardous pool in your sink, making any new effort to clear it more harmful. If your disposal's installation will require a new installing flange in the sink, you'll need to install that initially. If you're replacing an old disposer, remove it as talked about above.</p>

Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
