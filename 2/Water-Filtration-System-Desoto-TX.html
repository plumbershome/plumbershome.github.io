<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Desoto TX</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off.

The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.
