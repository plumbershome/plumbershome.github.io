<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells.

Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
