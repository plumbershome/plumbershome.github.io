<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Hiram GA</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your home.</p>
<p>We offer fast, very same day service and will send out a skilled professional to your home or service and do our best to make sure that you have hot water again as rapidly as possible. Whether our Charleston repiping experts discover a small amount of bad piping or we find problems with your whole system, the team at McAtee Plumbing Heating & Cooling will prioritize your safety and budget plan in any task we handle. After all, you called us to fix your piping problems, not your wallet.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).
