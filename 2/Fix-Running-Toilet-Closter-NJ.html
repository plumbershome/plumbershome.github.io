<p>Salt-free systems will also decrease scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier method. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no drainage, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance because the media can last as much as five years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
