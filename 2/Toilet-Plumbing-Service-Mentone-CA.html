Now, the abovementioned results of hard water are bothersome and irritating, however not awfully problematic. That is, up until you think about the harmful impact hard water has on plumbing appliances, components, and systems. Anti-Siphon Valves. If you prepare to use an anti-siphon valve go into 0 as the backflow preventer pressure loss.  The backflow preventer is part of the anti-siphon valve and the pressure loss is included with the valve so you will enter it later on.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found prevalent use given that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other. A set of four test cocks permit the operator to examine the valves and make sure they are not being forced open by collected particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected operational pressure to stream through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
