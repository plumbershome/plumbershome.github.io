I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

It likewise saves you cash and time due to the fact that a 2nd inspection isn't required.</p>
