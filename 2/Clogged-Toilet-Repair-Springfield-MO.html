The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
