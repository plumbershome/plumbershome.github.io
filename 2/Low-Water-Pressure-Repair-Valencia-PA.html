<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
