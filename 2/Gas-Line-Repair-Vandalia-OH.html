<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
