<p>In this circumstance, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are becoming more and more common, as both makers and consumers seek brand-new ways to save water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
