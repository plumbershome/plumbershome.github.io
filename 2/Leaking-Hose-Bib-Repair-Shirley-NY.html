If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you ought to take to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
