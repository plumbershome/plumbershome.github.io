<p>Leaks are sly. While the time needed will differ based on your home size and the number of discovered malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you schedule an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a really small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to schedule your consultation.</p>
<p>There are two types of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. Most homes make use of constant feed disposals, which indicates the disposal will work as long as it is switched on.

Our plumbers can help you decide which kind of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
