<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will differ based on the house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to reserve as much as two hours when you schedule an inspection. There's constantly the possibility that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). When you contact us to schedule your consultation, ask how long the inspection usually takes.</p>
