Don't be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they just represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you purchase the parts, don't be reluctant to request assistance.

Residences that use gas for heat or for other different home appliances have a gas line that links directly to the furnace, hot water heater, stove, and other home appliances that utilize gas.

<p>Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you might have a number of climatic vacuum breakers on your system, the water will only flow through one of them on its way to the emitters or sprinklers. Therefore, you only include the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your calculation. The majority of manufacturers don't have pressure loss information for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no manufacturer's literature is readily available.</p>
<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances? This is a good indication that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be changed. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only includes warm water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
