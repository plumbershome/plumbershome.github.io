<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
