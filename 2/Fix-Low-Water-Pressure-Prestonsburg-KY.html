The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, gradually, it still does rust. If you are currently experiencing clogged drains, we can help! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will frequently start to back up into your sink, which can result in odd smells.
