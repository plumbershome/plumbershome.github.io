<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
