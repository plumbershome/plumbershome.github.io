<p>This is among the main and first questions that you ought to ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and changing plumbing in your home.

If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping.

Because the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might want to buy an extended service warranty. Many warranties cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To avoid further malfunctions, homeowners need to keep up with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
