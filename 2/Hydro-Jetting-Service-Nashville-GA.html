<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is done for purposes of getting rid of bacterial issues and making the water drinkable. These are certainly concerns for a municipality and its locals but hard water can negatively impact faucets and appliances in a home.

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
