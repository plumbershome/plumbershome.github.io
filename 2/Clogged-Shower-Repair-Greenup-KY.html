<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
