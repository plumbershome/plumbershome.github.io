Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance because the media can last up to five years without changing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be replenished on a month-to-month basis.</p>
