<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

The customer has thirty days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be located on the water service line, within the building, or both places. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You may have to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
