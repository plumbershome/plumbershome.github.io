The pro will next examine your hot water heater. With your water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance job that avoids difficult water and sediment buildup. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to rinse out any buildup.</p>
<p>Foundation cracks. A broken main sewer line is more than simply a plumbing nuisance; it can trigger fantastic structural damage to your house. Broken sewer lines left without treatment over time can cause cracks in your house's structure, a settled structure, or perhaps sinkholes.
